# Protect your privacy
Protect your privacy. Originally hosted on Tumblr, bringing it to Github to make it easier for others to contribute.

Feedback, issues, and PRs welcome. URLs are listed rather than using hyperlinks to make the source clear.

_Disclaimer:_ The information and products below is for general information purposes only. Any reliance you place on such information is strictly at your own risk.

**Tips:**

- Fully open source = peer review, no backdoors. 
- Look for _fully_ open source tools, not just opened encryption implementation etc. 
- European data protection laws tend to be stronger. 
- Watch out for proprietary cores. 
- Before trying a new tool, check that it still exists, is secure (depending on your criteria), and has not been bought/taken over by another body which does not uphold high standards for security and privacy.
