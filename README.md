# Protect your privacy
Protect your privacy. Originally hosted on Tumblr, bringing it to Github to make it easier for others to contribute.

All feedback re: content and formatting welcomed. Look for _fully_ open source tools, not just opened encryption implementation etc. European data protection laws tend to be stronger. Watch out for proprietary cores. 

Inspired by CITIZENFOUR.
