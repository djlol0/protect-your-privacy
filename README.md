# Protect your privacy
Protect your privacy. Originally hosted on Tumblr, bringing it to Github to make it easier for others to contribute.

All feedback re: content and formatting welcomed. Look for _fully_ open source tools, not just opened encryption implementation etc. European data protection laws tend to be stronger. 

Inspired by CITIZENFOUR, and my Computer Forensics and Information Security studies during my MSc.
